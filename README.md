🌍 Tackling Climate Change with AI: A Deforestation Detection System Using CNNs
🧩 SDG Focus: Goal 13 – Climate Action
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with deforestation playing a major role. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing nearly 2.6 billion tons of CO₂ each year. However, illegal logging and unsustainable land clearing continue to destroy millions of hectares of forest annually, significantly accelerating global warming.

Despite efforts by governments and NGOs, many deforestation activities go undetected until it's too late. A real-time, automated monitoring system is urgently needed to prevent forest degradation and support early intervention efforts.

🤖 My AI Project: A Machine Learning Model for Deforestation Detection
To contribute toward SDG 13 (Climate Action), I developed a machine learning-based solution that uses satellite imagery to detect signs of deforestation. The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled satellite images to classify land as either "forest" or "deforested".

🔍 How It Works
Data Input: The model uses high-resolution satellite images of various forest regions.

Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and fed into the neural network.

CNN Model: The model learns spatial features from the images (e.g., tree canopy coverage, color patterns) and predicts whether an image shows a forested or deforested area.

Output: The system classifies new images in real-time, helping monitor forest changes over time.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

CNN (Supervised Learning)

ImageDataGenerator for data preprocessing

Matplotlib for visualization

💡 Why This Matters
This project demonstrates how supervised machine learning can be used for environmental monitoring. With a reliable detection system in place, governments and environmental organizations can:

Respond faster to illegal logging

Protect endangered ecosystems

Track climate commitments more accurately

Educate and engage communities with data

📈 Future Enhancements
To expand this project’s impact, I plan to:

Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze news and social media for real-time deforestation reports.

Add a map-based dashboard showing risk zones.

Train the model on data from global sources like Sentinel-2 or Planet Labs for broader accuracy.

✅ Conclusion
By combining machine learning and satellite imagery, this project offers a scalable, cost-effective way to support climate action and forest preservation. It's a clear example of how AI can be a powerful ally in solving real-world global challenges.

I’m excited to keep developing this project and welcome feedback or collaboration from others interested in climate tech or AI for good. 🌱🌍

Let’s build AI that makes a real difference. #SDG13 #AIforClimate #PLPAcademy
